## 📦 How to Setup (Restore from Archive)

Follow these steps to get the project running again after cloning:

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
And then just run the file...
As of rn, the project can only explore VTOP, it still isnt extracting shit from VTOP, let alone make a .ics file
